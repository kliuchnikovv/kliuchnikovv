## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Valerii, a Software Engineer with more than 6 years of commercial experience within fintech, e-commerce and blockchain industries, I specialize in developing reliable, scalable, and maintainable solutions, leveraging my technical expertise. With a diverse background that spans from building CRM and manufacturing planning systems to working on blockchain and fintech platforms, I bring both technical acumen and a deep understanding of business needs to create highly efficient, stable products designed to address real-world business challenges.

ðŸ”­ Now, in my free time, I specialize in developing tools aimed at easy integration into a project and support by developers (you can check [Engi framework](https://github.com/kliuchnikovv/engi) with its [example repo](https://github.com/kliuchnikovv/engi-example))

I'm interested mostly in backend and CI setup and improvement (mainly Gitlab-CI and Github Action, [Telegram Notify](https://github.com/kliuchnikovv/telegram-notify) for example), but sometimes try to create some frontend applications just for fun.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve started learning frontend but have no time for it right now:( (Svelte - can be found [here](https://github.com/kliuchnikovv/edicode), but also tried React)
